# 18F Cloud Foundry Deck

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/18F/cg-deck.svg?branch=staging-alpha)](https://travis-ci.org/18F/cg-deck)

[https://console-staging.cloud.gov](https://console-staging.cloud.gov)

The `staging-alpha` branch is being used for our React based rewrite and is continuously deployed to the URL above.

## Introduction

This ["deck"](#whats-a-deck) is a web application to manage cloud.gov organizations, spaces, services, and apps.

Learn more about [cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov).

## Tech Stack

### Backend Server [![Go Code Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/18F/cg-deck/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/18F/cg-deck?branch=master)
- `Go` (version 1.6.2)

### Front end application [![JS Code Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/18F/cg-deck/badge.svg?branch=staging-alpha&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/repos/18F/cg-deck/badge.svg?branch=staging-alpha&service=github)
- `Node` (version 4.2.3)
- `React` (version ^0.14.0)

## Setup
### Cloning the repository
If you are unfamiliar with [`Go` project directory structure](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces), you want the code in this repository to be in something like `<your-code-directory>/cg-deck-ws/src/github.com/18f/cg-deck`. You can use that exact pattern by cloning the repository with:

```
git clone git@github.com:18F/cg-deck.git cg-deck-ws/src/github.com/18F/cg-deck
```

### Create a Client with UAAC
- Make sure [UAAC](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-uaac) is installed.
- Target your UAA server. `uaac target <uaa.your-domain.com>`
- Login with your current UAA account. `uaac token client get <your admin account> -s <your uaa admin password>`
- Create client account:
```
uaac client add <your-client-id> \
 --authorities cloud_controller.admin,cloud_controller.read,cloud_controller.write,openid,scim.read \
 --authorized_grant_types authorization_code,client_credentials,refresh_token \
 --scope cloud_controller.admin,cloud_controller.read,cloud_controller.write,openid,scim.read \
-s <your-client-secret>
```
- Unable to create an account still? Troubleshoot [here](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/adminguide/uaa-user-management.html#creating-admin-users)

### Set the environment variables
If you are testing locally, export these variables. There is a sample file of environment variables called `env.sample`. Feel free to copy it and use the proper data. If you've never used environment variables before, you can run the following:
`mkdir ~/.env && cp ./env.sample ~/.env/cg-deck`

Then edit the file `~/.env/cg-deck` and provide the proper values. When you want to set all the environment variables, just run `source ~/.env/cg-deck`. You'll have to do this every time you open a new shell.

If you are deploying to cloud foundry, modify the `manifest.yml`

- `GOPATH`: The absolute path to your project root. If you followed the cloning instructions above, this path should end with `cg-deck-ws`
- `CONSOLE_CLIENT_ID`: Registered client id with UAA.
- `CONSOLE_CLIENT_SECRET`: The client secret.
- `CONSOLE_HOSTNAME`: The URL of the service itself.
- `CONSOLE_LOGIN_URL`: The base URL of the auth service. i.e. `https://login.domain.com`
- `CONSOLE_UAA_URL`: The URL of the UAA service. i.e. `https://uaa.domain.com`
- `CONSOLE_API_URL`: The URL of the API service. i.e. `http://api.domain.com`
- `CONSOLE_LOG_URL`: The URL of the loggregator service. i.e. `http://loggregator.domain.com`
- `PPROF_ENABLED`: <optional> If set to `true` or `1`, will turn on `/debug/pprof` endpoints as seen [here](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/)
- `CG_STYLE_PATH`: <optional> The absolute path to your `cg-style` repo. If set, will use a local copy of `cloudgov-style` to build the front end application.

## Front end
Front end build commands should be run in the same directory as the `package.json` file. If you've used the cloning command from this README it should be something like `/path/to/cg-deck-ws/src/github.com/18F/cg-deck`

Install front end dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Build the code:
```
npm run build
```
or to continually watch and build with changes:
```
npm run watch
```

To run the tests:
```
npm run test
```
or to continually watch for changes and run test suite (does not build front end app):
```
npm run watch-test
```

To lint the code:
```
npm run lint
```

In order to get correct synatax highlighting with vim, install the following
npm modules globally:

```
npm install -g eslint
npm install -g babel-eslint
npm install -g eslint-plugin-react
```

## Running locally
- Make sure all of your environment variables are set and you are using the Go version as mentioned above.
- Install [glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide)
- Run `glide install` to get all third party code
- `go run server.go`
- Navigate browser to [`http://localhost:9999`](http://localhost:9999)


## Unit Testing
### Running Go unit tests
- `go test $(glide nv)`

### Running Javascript unit tests
Test can then be run with the command:
```
npm run tests
```
To get a viewable coverage report change the `coverageReport` object in `karma.conf.js` from `json` to `html`
```
coverageReporter: {
    type: 'html',
    dir: 'coverage',
    subdir: '.'
}
```

### Acceptance Tests
This project currently uses a combination of [Agouti](http://agouti.org/) + [Ginkgo](http://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/) + [Gomega](http://onsi.github.io/gomega/) to provide BDD acceptance testing.
All the acceptance tests are in the 'acceptance' folder.


#### Setup
- Make sure you have PhantomJS installed: `brew install phantomjs`
- Install aogut: `go get github.com/sclevine/agouti`
- Install ginkgo `go get github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo`
- Install gomega `go get github.com/onsi/gomega`
- To run locally, in addition to the variables in the "Set the environmnent variables" section, you will need to set two more variables in your environment
- `CONSOLE_TEST_USERNAME`: The username of the account you want the tests to use to login into your `CONSOLE_LOGIN_URL`
- `CONSOLE_TEST_PASSWORD`: The password of the account you want the tests to use to login into your `CONSOLE_LOGIN_URL`
- `CONSOLE_TEST_ORG_NAME`: The test organization the user should be navigating to.
- `CONSOLE_TEST_SPACE_NAME`: The test space the user should be navigating to.
- `CONSOLE_TEST_APP_NAME`: The test app the user should be navigating to.
- `CONSOLE_TEST_HOST`: The host that the app can create a mock route for.
- `CONSOLE_TEST_DOMAIN`: The domain for the mock route.

#### Running acceptance tests
##### Make sure you have docker installed on your computer

For automated mode:

- `acceptance/scripts/run_test.sh -a`

For debug mode where the developer can vnc into the container and the browser execute the commands:

- `acceptance/scripts/run_test.sh -d`
- Once inside the container, run `acceptance/scripts/debug.sh`

## Deploying

The cloud.gov deck is continuously deployed by Travis-CI.

## CI
This project uses Travis-CI
- The following environment variables need to be set in plain text in the global env section:
  - `CONSOLE_API_URL`, `CONSOLE_UAA_URL`, `CONSOLE_LOG_URL`, `CONSOLE_LOGIN_URL`, `CONSOLE_HOSTNAME="http://localhost:9999"`, `CONSOLE_TEST_ORG_NAME`, `CONSOLE_TEST_SPACE_NAME`, and `CONSOLE_TEST_APP_NAME`
- In case you fork this project for your own use (no need to do this if forking to make a pull request), you will need to use the Travis-CI CLI tool to re-encrypt all the environment variables.
  - `travis encrypt CONSOLE_CLIENT_ID='<your client id>' --add env.global`
  - `travis encrypt CONSOLE_CLIENT_SECRET='<your client secret>' --add env.global`
  - `travis encrypt CONSOLE_TEST_PASSWORD='<the test user account password>' --add env.global`
  - `travis encrypt CONSOLE_TEST_USERNAME='<the test user account username>' --add env.global`
  - `travis encrypt CF_USERNAME='<the user account username used to deploy>' --add env.global`
  - `travis encrypt CF_PASSWORD='<the user account password used to deploy>' --add env.global`

## Whatâ€™s a Deck?

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprawl_trilogy#Glossary):

The Sprawl trilogy (also known as the Neuromancer, Cyberspace, or Matrix trilogy) is William Gibson's first set of novels, composed of Neuromancer (1984), Count Zero (1986), and Mona Lisa Overdrive (1988).

**Cyberspace Deck**

Also called a "deck" for short, it is used to access the virtual representation of the matrix. The deck is connected to a tiara-like device that operates by using electrodes to stimulate the user's brain while drowning out other external stimulation. As Case describes them, decks are basically simplified simstim units.
